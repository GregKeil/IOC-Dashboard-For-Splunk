# IOC Dashboard For Splunk
This dashboard is designed to identify IOC matches that the system administrator provides.

## Notes:
- For proper usage of this dashboard, datamodels must be established for Sysmon and Zeek.
- A lookup table containing the IOC information must also be established.
- In order to ensure that the datamodels stay up to date even when the analyst only looks at previously stored information, scheduled reports must be created.
